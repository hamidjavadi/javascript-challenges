Write `complementary(arr, target)` that finds two numbers in arr that add up to target. Return their indices as an array.
Assume exactly one solution exists.

> <sub><em>Solve it efficiently (avoid nested loops). Use a hash map (object)</em></sub>

```javascript
complementary([2, 7, 11, 15], 9); // [0, 1] (because 2 + 7 = 9)
```
